## What's Inside

### Organization Profile
The `profile/README.md` file is displayed on the Automation Dojo organization homepage, providing visitors with information about our mission and available resources.

### Community Health Files
These files will be used as defaults across all repositories in the organization that don't have their own versions.

## Local Development

This is a meta-repository for organization-level configurations. Most files here are consumed by GitHub directly to enhance the organization profile and provide default community health files.
